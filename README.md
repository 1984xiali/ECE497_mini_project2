step 1: Log into your beaglebone as root.
step 2: Use "mkdir yourDirectory" to create a directory to save all the files you need
step 3: Download all the files in this repository to yourDirectory.
step 4: Use command "make" to yield executable file "project2"
step 5: As long as you have "project2" file, type "./project2" under ubuntu to run the program.

Then you will see the 2 animations on your Adafruit 8*8 LED matrix.

Have fun.
